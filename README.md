# emacs-config

This is my emacs config file. Feel free to use it, if you find anything 
interesting for you in it. Below you can find the list of the packages that are
installed. You might decide to clone the whole repo and use the already
installed packages or to use only part of the init.el file and then 
install the needed packages by yourself.
